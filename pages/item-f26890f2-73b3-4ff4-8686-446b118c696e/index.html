<p>Sudah tidak sabar untuk mempraktekkan apa yang sudah dipahami tentang database. Okeee.&#160;😃</p>
<p>Mari kita membuat basis data yang bisa kita mainkan.</p>
<p>Anda akan membuat dua, satu di <code style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Liberation Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(164, 19, 87); word-break: break-word; font-weight: bold;">localhost</code>(PC Anda), dan satu di <vocab-term term="Infinity" information="Sebagaimana namanya, InfinityFree menawarkan hosting gratis “selamanya”.

<p>Di XAMPP CP (panel kontrol), jalankan Apache dan MySQL. Kemudian klik tombol DB admin.</p>
<media-image source="files/XAMPP.png" citation="XAMPP" accent-color="grey" size="wide" offset="none" card></media-image>
<p>phpMyAdmin akan dimulai. Ini adalah aplikasi web yang ditulis dalam PHP, jadi dimulai di browser.</p>
<p>Kini, MySQL memiliki sistem keamanannya sendiri, terpisah dari OS. Saat Anda mengakses DB MySQL, Anda melakukannya sebagai pengguna MySQL. Lebih mudah untuk membuat pengguna dan DB secara bersamaan.</p>
<meme-maker alt="pengguna infinityfree" image-url="https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/c3r.png" top-text="what" bottom-text=" Jadi pengguna MySQL tidak ada hubungannya dengan info pengguna INFINITYFREE saya?">

    <div> Jadi pengguna MySQL tidak ada hubungannya dengan info pengguna INFINITYFREE saya?</div></meme-maker>
<p>Benar. Pengguna MySQL adalah urusan mereka sendiri. Anda menggunakannya untuk terhubung ke DB Anda dalam program PHP, tetapi hanya itu saja.</p>
<p>Klik pada tab akun pengguna...</p>
<p><img alt="Tab akun pengguna" src="https://webapps.skilling.us/sites/default/files/lessons/databases/make-db/user-accounts-tab.png" title="Tab akun pengguna" ="false"=""="false" role="textbox"></p>
<p>...lalu tautan Tambahkan akun pengguna:</p>
<p><img alt="Tambahkan tautan akun pengguna" src="https://webapps.skilling.us/sites/default/files/lessons/databases/make-db/add-user-account.png" title="Tambahkan tautan akun pengguna" ="false"=""="false"></p>
<p>Formulir untuk membuat akun pengguna akan muncul. Isi kolom nama pengguna dan kata sandi. Centang "Buat basis data dengan nama yang sama dan berikan semua hak istimewa."</p>
<p><img alt="Bidang formulir" src="https://webapps.skilling.us/sites/default/files/lessons/databases/make-db/account-info.png" title="Bidang formulir" ="false"=""="false"></p>
<p>Saya membuat pengguna dengan nama <code style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Liberation Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(164, 19, 87); word-break: break-word; font-weight: bold;">wombat</code>, dan database bernama <code style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Liberation Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(164, 19, 87); word-break: break-word; font-weight: bold;">wombat</code>juga.</p>
<p>Klik tombol Go (kanan bawah halaman). Anda akan melihat pesan konfirmasi, dan DB baru pada daftar:</p>

<p>Mari buat akun di server Infinityfree Anda.</p>
<media-image source="files/image5.png" card citation="This is my citation." accent-color="grey" size="wide" offset="none"></media-image>
<p>pilih create now dengan $0 forever</p>
<p></p>
<media-image accent-color="grey" source="files/image3.png" citation="create hosting" size="wide" card offset="narrow"></media-image>
<p>Mari buat DB siswa di server Infinityfree Anda.</p>
<p>Cara termudah untuk melakukannya adalah dengan cPanel. Mudah itu bagus. Ini sama seperti yang Anda lakukan dengan phpMyAdmin di locahost, hanya dengan antarmuka yang sedikit berbeda.</p>
<p>Buka cPanel. Cari bagian Databases. Buka MySQL Databases.</p>
<media-image source="files/image9.png" card citation="Mysql Databases" accent-color="grey" size="wide" offset="narrow"></media-image>
<p>Tampilan pertama-tama meminta nama basis data. Saya akan menamainya db_latihan juga. Pilih Create database untuk membuat database.</p>
<media-image source="https://dummyimage.com/300x200/000/fff" card citation="This is my citation." accent-color="grey" size="wide" offset="none"></media-image>
<media-image source="files/image10.png" alt="files/image10.png" accent-color="grey" size="wide" offset="none"></media-image>
<p>Nama DB sedikit berbeda di server Anda. Ada hal-hal tambahan di awal.</p>
<meme-maker alt="pengguna infinityfree" image-url="https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/c3r.png" top-text="what" bottom-text="Mengapa demikian?">
    <div>what</div>
      <img src="https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/c3r.png" alt="pengguna infinityfree" preload="lazy" aria-describedby=""/>
    <div>Mengapa demikian?</div></meme-maker>
<p>Anda satu-satunya orang yang membuat DB di PC Anda. Jika Anda membuat DB bernama <b>dbsiswa</b>, hanya ada satu.</p>
<p>Akun server Anda berbeda. Untuk menekan biaya, Anda berbagi satu server Linux dengan orang lain. Apa yang terjadi jika beberapa dari Anda membuat DB siswa? Argh! Namanya bentrok.</p>
<p>Hmm. Apa yang harus dilakukan?</p>
<p>Setiap pengguna Infinityfree memiliki akun di server Linux mereka. Anda dapat melihat nama pengguna Linux Anda di halaman cPanel utama:</p>
<p><img alt="Nama pengguna Linux" src="https://webapps.skilling.us/sites/default/files/lessons/databases/make-db/linux-user.png" title="Nama pengguna Linux" ="false"=""="false"></p>
<p>Nama pengguna Anda unik. Server Anda menggunakan fakta itu untuk membuat nama DB yang unik.</p>
<p>Jika nama pengguna Anda adalah rosie, direktori home Anda akan menjadi <code style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Liberation Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(164, 19, 87); word-break: break-word; font-weight: bold;">/home/rosie</code>. Anda dapat melihatnya di File Manager cPanel.</p>
<p>Untuk menjaga agar nama DB Anda tetap unik, cPanel menambahkan nama pengguna Linux Anda di bagian depan:</p>
<p><img alt="Nama DB" src="https://webapps.skilling.us/sites/default/files/lessons/databases/make-db/db-name.png" title="Nama DB" ="false"=""="false"></p>
<p>Jadi nama sebenarnya DB <em>di server itu</em> adalah dblatihan.</p>
<meme-maker alt="pengguna infinityfree" image-url="https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/c3r.png" top-text="what" bottom-text="  Bisakah saya menggunakan nama yang sama untuk DB localhost?">
    <div>what</div>
      <img src="https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/c3r.png" alt="pengguna infinityfree" preload="lazy" aria-describedby=""/>
    <div>  Bisakah saya menggunakan nama yang sama untuk DB localhost?</div></meme-maker>
<p>Bisakah saya menggunakan nama yang sama untuk DB di <code style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Liberation Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(164, 19, 87); word-break: break-word; font-weight: bold;">localhost</code>?</p>
<p>Ya, Anda bisa! Kalau begitu, hasilnya akan sama saja. Bagus! Tapi Anda tidak perlu melakukannya. Saya biasanya tidak peduli.</p>
<p>Klik Berikutnya untuk melanjutkan ke langkah berikutnya dalam panduan. Panduan akan meminta Anda untuk membuat pengguna.</p>
<p><img alt="Membuat pengguna" src="https://webapps.skilling.us/sites/default/files/lessons/databases/make-db/cp_db_user.png" title="Membuat pengguna" ="false"=""="false"></p>
<p>Sekali lagi, nama Linux Anda akan ditambahkan di bagian depan. Ingat, ini hanyalah pengguna MySQL, tidak digunakan untuk hal lain.</p>
<p>Pastikan Anda mencatat kata sandi di suatu tempat, dan klik Buat pengguna.</p>
<p>Sekarang tambahkan pengguna ke DB, dengan semua hak istimewa.</p>
<p><img alt="Tambahkan pengguna ke DB" src="https://webapps.skilling.us/sites/default/files/lessons/databases/make-db/add-user-to-db.png" title="Tambahkan pengguna ke DB" ="false"=""="false"></p>
<p>Klik Langkah berikutnya, dan selesai.</p>
<h3 data-original-level="H3" id="header-48e0a398-8eb2-005e-4ccf-afa4ebe03df7">Dua DB</h3>
<p>Anda punya dua DB, satu di <code style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Liberation Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(164, 19, 87); word-break: break-word; font-weight: bold;">localhost</code>, dan yang satu lagi di server Reclaim Anda. Apaan nih!</p>
<p>Sekarang, mari kita membuat tabel pada satu DB, dan mengekspor hasilnya ke DB lain.</p>
